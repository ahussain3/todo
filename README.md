# TODO

A lightweight vim based todo manager inspired by this [logbook](https://routley.io/tech/2017/11/23/logbook.html) system.

Check out this [write up](https://awais.io/my-new-to-do-management-system/) for more information.

## Installation instructions (WIP):

```
git clone git@github.com:ahussain3/todo.git ~/todo
```

Make the tool runnable from anywhere by adding it to somewhere on your path. E.g.
```
ln -s ~/todo/todo /usr/local/bin
```

## Still to do on this project:
* Make ROOT_DIR more easily configurable
* Add support for multiline todos
* Add support for nested todos
